**Assistant:**

Okay, the checkpointing logic has been added to `main.py`. The script will now attempt to resume from the last completed city if the `last_completed_city` value is found in the database `progress` table.

**Step 2: Enhance Error Handling (Review)**

I have reviewed the existing error handling in `backend/modules/request_handler.py`. It already includes:
*   Retries (default 3) for most request failures.
*   Exponential backoff with jitter between retries.
*   Specific handling for common HTTP errors like 401 (Auth), 403 (Forbidden), and 429 (Rate Limit).
*   Timeout handling.

For now, this seems reasonably robust. We can revisit this if the US-wide scan encounters frequent, specific errors that aren't handled well.

**Step 3: Get Full US City List**

I will now use the Perplexity MCP server to request a list of US Craigslist subdomains.

```tool_code
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>researcher-mcp</server_name>
<tool_name>search</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "query": "Provide a comprehensive list of Craigslist city/region subdomain codes for the United States (e.g., 'newyork', 'losangeles', 'chicago', 'sfbay', 'dayton'). Aim for a list covering major metropolitan areas and states."
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

**Assistant:**

Okay, the request to the Perplexity MCP server timed out while trying to get the comprehensive US city list. This might happen with very broad queries that require extensive searching or generation.

I will try again with a slightly more constrained query, focusing on getting a list source rather than the list directly in the response.

```tool_code
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>researcher-mcp</server_name>
<tool_name>search</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "query": "Find a reliable online source or list that contains US Craigslist city/region subdomain codes (e.g., 'newyork', 'losangeles', 'sfbay')."
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

**User:**

[use_mcp_tool for 'researcher-mcp'] Result:
For a comprehensive list of Craigslist city/region subdomain codes in the United States, you can refer to the dataset on GitHub by Jeff Thompson, which includes all Craigslist locations formatted as subdomains (e.g., `newyork.craigslist.org`, `losangeles.craigslist.org`) [1]. Another resource, Zen Grain’s Craigslist Region Search Generator, categorizes subdomain codes for regions and cities across different areas, such as California and the Bay Area (e.g., `sfbay`, `sacramento`) [5]. Both resources provide reliable access and are relevant to finding regional Craigslist subdomains.

**Assistant:**

Okay, Perplexity pointed to a potentially useful resource: a dataset on GitHub by Jeff Thompson that supposedly lists all Craigslist locations.

To get this list, I need to access that GitHub resource. Since I cannot directly browse the web or clone git repositories, I will attempt to use a `curl` command to download the raw file content if a direct link to the raw data file can be constructed or inferred.

Based on common GitHub structures, I'll try downloading a likely file path. This might require adjustment if the exact path is different.

```tool_code
<execute_command>
<command>curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffThompson/AllCraigslistLocations/master/craigslistLocations.txt -o backend/data/cities_us_raw.txt</command>
<requires_approval>false</requires_approval>
</execute_command>
```
This command attempts to download the file `craigslistLocations.txt` from the specified GitHub repository and save it as `backend/data/cities_us_raw.txt`. The `-L` flag follows redirects.

**Assistant:**

Okay, the `curl` command executed, but it seems to have downloaded a very small file (only 14 bytes according to the output: `100 14 100 14`). This likely means the URL was incorrect or the file content isn't what we expected.

Let's check the content of the downloaded file `backend/data/cities_us_raw.txt` to see what's inside.

```tool_code
<read_file>
<path>backend/data/cities_us_raw.txt</path>
</read_file>

**Assistant:**

Okay, the file contains "404: Not Found". This confirms the URL I constructed for the raw GitHub file was incorrect.

Finding the exact raw file URL programmatically is difficult. Let's try asking Perplexity again, specifically requesting the direct URL to the raw text or CSV file from that GitHub repository, if possible.

```tool_code
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>researcher-mcp</server_name>
<tool_name>search</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "query": "Find the direct URL to the raw data file (e.g., .txt, .csv) containing the list of US Craigslist locations from Jeff Thompson's GitHub repository 'AllCraigslistLocations'."
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```
