    "url": "https://orangecounty.craigslist.org/cpg/d/orange-consultant-needed-streamline-b2b/7836949019.html",
    "description": "Project Description: We are a small yet focused merchandise and branded apparel business with a dedicated team of five, processing approximately five to ten orders daily. Our operations support a variety of clients, and we are seeking an experienced consultant to help streamline and automate key processes. Currently, our workflows involve manual steps for inventory tracking, order releases, and invoicing. We’re eager to explore cost-effective, technology-driven solutions tailored to our needs and scale.\nWhile integration with a large client’s ERP system (via cXML PunchOut) is a potential future consideration, our immediate priority is automating internal workflows and improving our inventory and order management processes. If applicable, we are open to exploring integration solutions aligned with PunchOut protocols and PromoStandards. More information about PromoStandards can be found at PromoStandards.org.\nKey Project Goals: Analyze current workflows, particularly around inventory tracking and order releases.\nRecommend and assist in implementing software solutions for B2B e-commerce and inventory management.\nAutomate processes such as work order creation, inventory adjustments, and invoicing.\nExplore and recommend integration solutions like PunchOut protocols and PromoStandards, if applicable.\nExample Challenge: One specific process we aim to improve is our apparel release workflow, which is just one example of the broader services we provide to clients. Currently, we bulk produce items efficiently; however, inventory is manually entered into QuickBooks Desktop. When clients request a release, we manually create a \"work order\" in QuickBooks Desktop to fulfill the shipment, which also adjusts inventory. Shipping costs are then invoiced quarterly, as the products are prepaid on net terms. While this process works, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. We are looking for modern, technology-driven solutions to streamline these steps and enhance efficiency.\nIdeal Candidate: Strong expertise in B2B e-commerce platforms and inventory management systems.\nExperience with automation tools and API integrations to improve workflows.  Knowledge of solutions tailored to merchandise or apparel businesses.\nFamiliarity with tools like ShipStation, PunchOut capabilities, PromoStandards, and ERP systems (preferred but not mandatory).\nDeliverables: A detailed analysis of current processes with actionable recommendations for improvement.\nAssistance in selecting and implementing software or tools for B2B inventory and order management.\nRedesigned workflows to automate and optimize operations.\nSupport for transitioning to new tools or technologies with minimal disruption.\nBudget: Open to proposals based on the complexity and scope of the project.\nHow to Apply: Please include the following in your proposal:\nA summary of your experience with similar projects.\nExamples of tools or technologies you’ve implemented for B2B e-commerce or inventory management.\nAny experience with PunchOut, PromoStandards, or ERP integrations (if applicable).\nAn estimated timeline and cost for completion.\nSkills Required\neCommerce\nInventory Management\nWorkflow Consulting\nERP Software\nBusiness Consulting",

I've had my company since 2018 and mainly take on freelance work as I have a full time job. I am looking to partner with someone who would be open to help with sales, lead gen, and even second shooting for some projects. I think collaboration is very important and am looking for someone with a creative background specifically in the media production space.\nI've worked on some really cool projects throughout the years. It could be an awesome opportunity for someone who has a flexible schedule and would be willing to collaborate. There is endless opportunities with this but would require a person that has the right mentality and willingness to learn and grow. If you're interested put in the email subject line: Creative Gig 2025\nPlease include a link to your resume or portfolio of work. Thanks!",

Basic familiarity with Twitter, Instragram, and Facebook a plus.  Familiarity with WordPress and/or online platforms (Soundcloud, Podbean, etc) are a bonus but not required.\nThis is a LIVE-IN and Barter position. You will work part-time doing graphic design for our websites, social media, and publishers. You’ll also do light Social Media postings and light office and administrative work—we manage a consultative referral service which we’ll train you how to operate.\nTo be clear, this is an Exchange and BARTER position. You will receive a Private Room and Board (valued at $1400/month) as compensation for part-time work. In return you'll get a nice, fairly large, private studio room with private bathroom and shower, all you can eat food (we buy your food twice a week), free internet, free onsite laundry, full use of an industrial/commercial kitchen, and free parking all set within a very cool bohemian atmosphere in our fairly large Temple City location. We are in an upscale area with plenty of restaurants, parks, shops, and public transit nodes all within walking distance. You’ll be a part of a community of professionals: artists, technologists, writers, graphic designers, videographers, and business types that work together in a communal space.\nEven though this is a Barter position, there are different opportunities to earn income ($10 -$35/hour and more) working with us. There is also the potential for advancement here.  But, if you just want to only do the barter/work exchange than that is fine as well (no pressure).\nTO APPLY FOR THE POSITION: PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING\nPlease send a resume, 3 - 5 graphic design samples, your social media links and a well-written personal email about why you feel you fit this position to the CL relay email address:\nPlease be sure to include your contact number and direct email address.\nQuestions?

    "description": "Hello guys. Seeking a colorist for small indie racing film. Running time aprox. 78 min. Must have experience in color matching and overlays. We will be mixing CGI shots and some video game footage to actual camera shots on RED KOMODO so it is important to be able to smooth out color pallets and keep a uniform look. Sadly we all know Hollywood is in it's death throws, but some of us are still committed to making films in SoCal. Again being a small 'micro-studio' we have to make sure we can do a lot with a small budget. But also looking for people to create a team as we have other projects in the pipeline. All I can say is that I'm very easy to work with and have produced and written other feature films that are distributed so once we have met happy to share more on the project and my credits. This is a real ad. Also if you are looking for your first colorist credit - happy to talk more. Thanks for reading.",

So the video would not be longer than 2 to 3 minutes of time.  We can agree up front what you would charge for this AI video development.  Thank you, Paul.",

    "description": "I have been a business owner of 22+ years. However, my lovely clients over the past five years have decided to short change me every single time. Therefore, I am starting a new business, but I need help. I need a kind, talented, and artistic person to help me with a website. Ideally, you would be someone who has an interest for the arts, vintage, antiques, etc. I am not looking for a cold, basic site. Can you help? I am able to help with internships and college credits if you put me in touch with professors, etc. If the image posted appeals to you- that is my style.",

    "description": "I want to make a painting out of a photo I took and gift it to someone.\nBut i want to be part of the creation process so this job will involve me providing the supplies (lmk what you need eg paint, canvas; i will send you the pic and we can discuss), and then we make it together.\nI am a rank beginner nor artistically included. We have 8 weeks if we start on april 6th to get this done. You can do the heavy lifting but coach me on simpler aspects of the painting. Open to watercolor/acrylic/oil etc. and style (realistic vs more impressionist etc.) size of painting, we can discuss all of it.\nPS. Im getting photoshop inquiries and to be clear this is an actual painting gig we are copying a picture I took onto canvas",
