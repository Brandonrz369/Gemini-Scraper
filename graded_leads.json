    "description": "Hello!\nI'm a Certified Holistic Health Practitioner, Nutritionist, Hypnotherapist. I'm looking for someone who's familiar with the natural healing industry and would know how to find me targeted clients. I would only need you to land me 4 per month, but you can get me more and make more money. These clients can be anywhere in the US, as I do my sessions with them over Zoom.\nI offer clients a free 30-minute consultation, and then once they sign up for my program, I offer them an \"8 Weeks to Healing\" program, for which I charge the $3000.\nYou'll earn $500 per client for the first 4 clients in any given month, and then you'd earn $750 per client for anything after 4 clients for any given month. This is commission only until you can help me get just 4 clients, and I would then start paying you a set retainer amount each month, unless of course you wanted to keep it at a commission. That would be up to you. I'd also be open to working out a combination of a set retainer amount plus commission, which would of course be less than if it was commission only.\nLastly, please note that I'm placing this ad due to the fact that I cannot afford to pay regular marketing rates until I get at least 4 clients, so please, no big marketing companies. I'm only looking for an individual who knows how to market something like this without all the costly, fancy stuff. If there is a cost on your part, I can cover it as long as it's reasonable. I don't want you to have to come out of pocket.\nThanks for reading, and call or email me if interested!",

I am looking for somebody to convert the current store sign to a sign for the gallery.\nBuilding landlord has already agreed to replace Trim (quarter rounds around perimeter) at no cost. If I were to accept this offer, I would be running the risk of receiving a. ‘Landlord special’…. So, if you’d like to throw that into your quote, go for it.  Here are the specs from a quote and other sign company gave me. They don’t have to be exact. The sign just has to be a good one.\nPlease feel free to reach me via text, or call and leave a voicemail. A sentence or two summarizing why you’d be a good candidate for this gig wouldn’t hurt.\nThank you.\nSpecs:\nP.O. No.\nDescription\nItem A- Manufacture & Install (1) 3' x 19' s/f non-illuminated wall sign with fcos. \"art\" is 2'2\" x 4'5-3/4\", \"HUB\" is 1'7-1/2\" x 4'4-3/4\". Hub is fcos also.

If attendance is necessary, you will be charged an additional fee of $140.00 per hour.\nCosts associated with city or town permit fees are not included. These are additional and will be added to your final invoice.\nGeneral terms and conditions: Due to the current volatile increases of raw material costs, this quote is valid for only 10 days. After 10 days, there may be incremental cost overages reflected on the final invoice depending on the time of purchasing the raw material for your job.\nCosts listed above do not include, unless specifically noted in the quote, primary electrical circuits to the sign location, out of NH State tax, unusual digging conditions or unforeseen complications that may arise during the project.\nFor customers without pre-approved 30 days terms, payment is expected upon completion and/or delivery.

    "description": "I need someone for Website Design and hosting for a subscription-based reference that would be accessed by subscribers via the website. This is an encyclopedic compilation and compendium of humorous quips, quotes, witticisms, jokes, thoughts, and one-liners for the not-so-serious entertainer, speaker, and writer. The reference is over 2400 pages of standard Word text.\nTypically, the subscribers would search by first using the Table of Contents and then proceed to any topic of interest. It should also have a word search feature like we might find in a Word document or an e-book. Most importantly I would like to protect the contents as a whole from being easily copied. Subscribers must be able to copy a reasonable amount of material for their personal use. So, am looking for your best suggestions as to how we might effectively accomplish this. The document must be user friendly while at the same time perhaps limiting the viewing screen or amount of allowed use during a specific time period. Maybe it should be limited in the number of lines that can be viewed before moving to the following pages. Another possibility is limiting the number of entries (gags and jokes) a subscriber could view in a given time period. We will need to discuss your ideas.\nThe website would also be used for initially signing up new customers using PayPal or credit cards. We must also be able to track exactly when new user’s subscriptions will expire and send a couple reminders to them prior to that date. The length of a subscription is still being considered (one month or one year?).\nPlease send me your suggestions on the structure of the site, anticipated costs, and how to best proceed.  Thank you…",

I plan to conduct one more intense marketing push for the next 2 years to get the company ready to sell in early 2027.\nI need help with SEO, social media, and anything else that makes good sense these days.\nHere’s the gig. I’m not going to pay the expert that I select a flat rate to perform X amount of tasks and I’m not going to pay an hourly rate.\nThe way I will compensate the person I choose will be by commission. My product’s price range is between $2,700 to 3,500. We’ve sold over 5000 over the years and have NEVER had a return (seriously). This method of compensation will be MUCH MORE lucrative for the right person than a job/hourly rate.\nI have a mistake proof tracking system that will direct all appropriate commissions to the person responsible.\nPiquarium is a multiple award winning product that is manufactured in Northern California.\nI need someone that I can partner with that is very confident in their abilities and that isn’t afraid to put a little skin (time) in the game for a much better return than an hourly rate or job rate. Each unit we sell because of your efforts will put money in your pocket.\nIf you have the expertise and the confidence to want to discuss further, please spend some time on my website www.piquarium.com and get to know my product a little bit. Then, if interested in furthering the conversation, send me an email with a paragraph stating your interest and your experience, and if we end up working together, we will figure out a commission percentage based on your experience and creativity.\nMy company will obviously pay for any ads/fees that are needed.\nPLEASE DO NOT RESPOND IF YOU’RE NOT INTERESTED IN THE COMMISSION PLAN I’VE DESCRIBED\nThank you!\nMark Robert McGrath\nFounder, President\nPiquarium, Inc.

This is not a heavily managed job but rather a collaboration of skills & resources, and an opportunity for extra cash throughout the week through my business.\nFeel free to reach out with any questions, thanks.\n6l9 - 88O - 6two6six\nMarshall",

    "description": "The Off Topic Show podcast is seeking a skilled graphic designer to create two bold, unique shirt designs for our StayHighlyPositive.com webstore. We need creative, high-quality work that captures our unapologetic vibe and resonates with our audience. Each design pays $100, with potential for ongoing collaboration if we click. Here’s what we’re looking for:\n1. “Piss Up a Rope” Shirt\nConcept: Our host’s favorite troll-slaying catchphrase—think funny, edgy, and bold.\nDesign Goals: Playful typography (cartoonish or handwritten) paired with a humorous graphic—like a rope twisting comically or a cheeky troll face. Keep it light, not crude. Use bright colors (yellow, green, blue) on a black base for a positive yet striking look. Center it on the chest or wrap it dynamically with the rope.\nVibe: Reflects the host’s no-nonsense attitude and livestream banter.\n2. Military/Camo Logo Redesign\nConcept: Reimagine our Off Topic Show logo with a rugged, tactical edge\nDesign Goals: Keep the logo’s core elements but infuse a military/camo aesthetic—think gritty textures, muted greens, or bold stencil fonts. Perfect for fans who love a tough, standout style.\nBonus Project: “LOSER” Redesign (Optional Pitch)\nCurrent Design: Black shirt, “LOSER” in white graffiti-style font with a green “N.”\nDesign Goals: Elevate the street-art feel—try neon or metallic text, add doodles (skulls, scratches), or switch to a distressed block style. Maybe hint at my “Hollywood” tattoo with a star or palm tree. Stretch it across the chest or scale it creatively.\nDetails:\nBoth shirts will live on StayHighlyPositive.com, tying into my brand and content.\nPay is $100 per design, with room for more projects if we vibe.\nTake creative risks—mockups encouraged! If you need more brand specifics, just ask.\nTo Apply: Send your portfolio or past work, plus a quick note on how you’d tackle these designs. Excited to see your ideas!",

I am a film director working on 'The Little Man'— a student short film-symphony set in Austria and Germany, shot in Los Angeles and New York.\nThe Little Man tells the story of an 18-year-old Austrian painter who lacks the talent for depicting humans. It is a period anti-fascist metaphor for one of the biggest monsters of our past. Current Project Status: Post-Production (final stages). Festival Submissions (Start): April 2025.\nI’m looking for an artist to create a piece that will serve as a poster for 'The Little Man'. Its style should reflect the film’s setting: early 1900s Austria and Germany. Though the work may not take long, I’d like a creative approach and will prioritise candidates with knowledge of art history.\nIf you're interested and available, feel free to email me with some portfolio works. I look forward to connecting :)",

    "description": "Project Description: We are a small yet focused merchandise and branded apparel business with a dedicated team of five, processing approximately five to ten orders daily. Our operations support a variety of clients, and we are seeking an experienced consultant to help streamline and automate key processes. Currently, our workflows involve manual steps for inventory tracking, order releases, and invoicing. We’re eager to explore cost-effective, technology-driven solutions tailored to our needs and scale.\nWhile integration with a large client’s ERP system (via cXML PunchOut) is a potential future consideration, our immediate priority is automating internal workflows and improving our inventory and order management processes. If applicable, we are open to exploring integration solutions aligned with PunchOut protocols and PromoStandards. More information about PromoStandards can be found at PromoStandards.org.\nKey Project Goals: Analyze current workflows, particularly around inventory tracking and order releases.\nRecommend and assist in implementing software solutions for B2B e-commerce and inventory management.\nAutomate processes such as work order creation, inventory adjustments, and invoicing.\nExplore and recommend integration solutions like PunchOut protocols and PromoStandards, if applicable.\nExample Challenge: One specific process we aim to improve is our apparel release workflow, which is just one example of the broader services we provide to clients. Currently, we bulk produce items efficiently; however, inventory is manually entered into QuickBooks Desktop. When clients request a release, we manually create a \"work order\" in QuickBooks Desktop to fulfill the shipment, which also adjusts inventory. Shipping costs are then invoiced quarterly, as the products are prepaid on net terms. While this process works, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. We are looking for modern, technology-driven solutions to streamline these steps and enhance efficiency.\nIdeal Candidate: Strong expertise in B2B e-commerce platforms and inventory management systems.\nExperience with automation tools and API integrations to improve workflows.  Knowledge of solutions tailored to merchandise or apparel businesses.\nFamiliarity with tools like ShipStation, PunchOut capabilities, PromoStandards, and ERP systems (preferred but not mandatory).\nDeliverables: A detailed analysis of current processes with actionable recommendations for improvement.\nAssistance in selecting and implementing software or tools for B2B inventory and order management.\nRedesigned workflows to automate and optimize operations.\nSupport for transitioning to new tools or technologies with minimal disruption.\nBudget: Open to proposals based on the complexity and scope of the project.\nHow to Apply: Please include the following in your proposal:\nA summary of your experience with similar projects.\nExamples of tools or technologies you’ve implemented for B2B e-commerce or inventory management.\nAny experience with PunchOut, PromoStandards, or ERP integrations (if applicable).\nAn estimated timeline and cost for completion.\nSkills Required\neCommerce\nInventory Management\nWorkflow Consulting\nERP Software\nBusiness Consulting",

Basic familiarity with Twitter, Instragram, and Facebook a plus.  Familiarity with WordPress and/or online platforms (Soundcloud, Podbean, etc) are a bonus but not required.\nThis is a LIVE-IN and Barter position. You will work part-time doing graphic design for our websites, social media, and publishers. You’ll also do light Social Media postings and light office and administrative work—we manage a consultative referral service which we’ll train you how to operate.\nTo be clear, this is an Exchange and BARTER position. You will receive a Private Room and Board (valued at $1400/month) as compensation for part-time work. In return you'll get a nice, fairly large, private studio room with private bathroom and shower, all you can eat food (we buy your food twice a week), free internet, free onsite laundry, full use of an industrial/commercial kitchen, and free parking all set within a very cool bohemian atmosphere in our fairly large Temple City location. We are in an upscale area with plenty of restaurants, parks, shops, and public transit nodes all within walking distance. You’ll be a part of a community of professionals: artists, technologists, writers, graphic designers, videographers, and business types that work together in a communal space.\nEven though this is a Barter position, there are different opportunities to earn income ($10 -$35/hour and more) working with us. There is also the potential for advancement here.  But, if you just want to only do the barter/work exchange than that is fine as well (no pressure).\nTO APPLY FOR THE POSITION: PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING\nPlease send a resume, 3 - 5 graphic design samples, your social media links and a well-written personal email about why you feel you fit this position to the CL relay email address:\nPlease be sure to include your contact number and direct email address.\nQuestions?

Sadly we all know Hollywood is in it's death throws, but some of us are still committed to making films in SoCal. Again being a small 'micro-studio' we have to make sure we can do a lot with a small budget. But also looking for people to create a team as we have other projects in the pipeline. All I can say is that I'm very easy to work with and have produced and written other feature films that are distributed so once we have met happy to share more on the project and my credits.

Open to watercolor/acrylic/oil etc. and style (realistic vs more impressionist etc.) size of painting, we can discuss all of it.\nPS. Im getting photoshop inquiries and to be clear this is an actual painting gig we are copying a picture I took onto canvas",
