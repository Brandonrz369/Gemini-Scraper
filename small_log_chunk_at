# Current Mode
PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)

**Assistant:**

<plan_mode_respond>
<response>It looks like our session was interrupted again. The last step I attempted was to execute Run B of the A/B test (scraping Dayton and Akron/Canton) using the command:
`.venv/bin/python backend/main.py --target-cities dayton,akroncanton --limit-pages 3`

Since I didn't receive confirmation before the interruption, we should assume it didn't complete successfully.

We are currently in PLAN MODE. How would you like to proceed?
1.  Retry executing Run B of the A/B test (requires switching back to ACT MODE).
2.  Review the plan or discuss other steps.</response>
<options>
["Retry Run B (Switch to ACT MODE)", "Review the plan", "Discuss something else"]

<plan_mode_respond>
<response>Yes, you're right. We can check if the last command (Run B: scraping Dayton and Akron/Canton) completed successfully by examining the log file it generates.

The script writes its progress and any errors to `backend/run.log`. By looking at the end of that file, we can see if it reached the "--- Agent Finished ---" message or if it stopped prematurely.

Would you like me to check the `backend/run.log` file to determine the status of the last command execution? This requires switching to ACT MODE.</response>

**Assistant:**

Great! The last lines of the log file show the "--- Agent Finished ---" message. This confirms that the previous execution of Run B (scraping Dayton and Akron/Canton) completed successfully.

Both Run A and Run B of the A/B test have now been executed.

The database `backend/data/leads.db` contains the results, tagged with `search_scope='single_city'` for Run A and `search_scope='small_region'` for Run B. The output files (`daily_leads_*.csv`, `leads_dashboard.html`, `graded_leads.json`) reflect the combined results up to the completion of Run B.

The A/B test execution is complete and the data is ready for analysis.

```tool_code
<attempt_completion>
<result>
Both runs of the simplified A/B test have been successfully executed:

1.  **Run A (Dayton only):** Completed, results tagged with `search_scope='single_city'`.
2.  **Run B (Dayton & Akron/Canton):** Completed, results tagged with `search_scope='small_region'`.

The database `backend/data/leads.db` now contains the combined results from both runs, tagged appropriately. You can analyze this data by filtering on the `search_scope` column to compare the performance of scraping a single city versus a small region. The output files (`daily_leads_*.csv`, `leads_dashboard.html`, `graded_leads.json`) have also been updated with the latest data.
</result>
</attempt_completion>
```

**Assistant:**

You can check the results by querying the SQLite database located at `backend/data/leads.db`. The leads from the two test runs are tagged in the `search_scope` column as either `'single_city'` (Run A: Dayton only) or `'small_region'` (Run B: Dayton & Akron/Canton).

I can run some basic queries for you using the `sqlite3` command-line tool to show a comparison.

**Step 1: Count leads per search scope.**

```tool_code
<execute_command>
<command>sqlite3 backend/data/leads.db "SELECT search_scope, COUNT(*) FROM leads GROUP BY search_scope;"</command>
<requires_approval>false</requires_approval>
</execute_command>
```

**User:**

[execute_command for 'sqlite3 backend/data/leads.db "SELECT search_scope, COUNT(*) FROM leads GROUP BY search_scope;"'] Result:
Command executed.
Output:
Command 'sqlite3' not found but can be installed with:

**Assistant:**

Ah, it seems the `sqlite3` command-line tool is not installed on your system.

As an alternative, I can write a small Python script to connect to the database (`backend/data/leads.db`) and run the query to count the leads per `search_scope`.

**Step 1: Create a Python script to query the database.**

```tool_code
<write_to_file>
<path>analyze_ab_test.py</path>
<content>
import sqlite3
import os
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

**Assistant:**

Okay, the analysis script ran successfully and provided the lead counts for each test run:

```
--- A/B Test Lead Counts ---
Search Scope: Untagged/Other, Lead Count: 3
Search Scope: single_city, Lead Count: 1
Search Scope: small_region, Lead Count: 1
--------------------------
```

**Interpretation:**

*   **Untagged/Other (3 leads):** These are likely leads that were already in the database before we added the `search_scope` tagging or from runs where the scope wasn't correctly passed (like the failed attempts).
*   **single\_city (1 lead):** Run A (Dayton only) found 1 new lead that passed all filters.
*   **small\_region (1 lead):** Run B (Dayton & Akron/Canton) found 1 new lead that passed all filters. This lead likely came from Akron/Canton, as the Dayton leads would have been duplicates from Run A and ignored by the database constraint.

**Conclusion from this initial test:** In this specific test run (limited to 3 pages per category), expanding the scope from just Dayton to include Akron/Canton yielded one additional lead.

**Further Analysis:**

You can perform more detailed analysis by:

1.  **Examining the Output Files:** Check the latest CSV (`backend/data/daily_leads_*.csv`), HTML dashboard (`backend/data/leads_dashboard.html`), or JSON (`frontend/public/graded_leads.json`) which contain details of all leads currently in the database.
2.  **Direct Database Query:** Use a tool like DB Browser for SQLite to open `backend/data/leads.db` and run more complex SQL queries (e.g., comparing AI scores, specific lead details between the 'single\_city' and 'small\_region' scopes).
3.  **Running More Tests:** Modify `analyze_ab_test.py` or run more `sqlite3` commands (if you install it) to explore the data further.

The A/B test setup and execution are complete, and the initial results have been presented.

```tool_code
<attempt_completion>
<result>
The A/B test comparing the 'single_city' (Dayton) and 'small_region' (Dayton & Akron/Canton) scraping scopes has been successfully executed.

The initial analysis shows the following lead counts added during the test:
*   `search_scope='single_city'`: 1 lead
*   `search_scope='small_region'`: 1 lead

This suggests that in this limited test (3 pages per category), expanding the scope to include Akron/Canton yielded one additional lead compared to scraping only Dayton.

The database `backend/data/leads.db` contains the detailed results tagged by `search_scope` for further analysis. You can also examine the generated output files:
*   `backend/data/daily_leads_*.csv`
*   `backend/data/leads_dashboard.html`
*   `frontend/public/graded_leads.json`

**Assistant:**

Okay, let's analyze the results and make an informed prediction using additional context from the Perplexity MCP server.

**Current A/B Test Results:**

*   **Run A (Dayton only):** 1 new lead found.
*   **Run B (Dayton + Akron/Canton):** 1 new lead found (likely from Akron/Canton).

**Interpretation:**

This extremely limited test suggests that adding Akron/Canton *did* yield an additional lead that wasn't found by searching Dayton alone. This supports the hypothesis that a wider scope can increase lead volume. However, with only one lead difference, we can't confidently say the 'small\_region' approach is significantly more *effective* overall without considering lead quality and the cost of scraping more areas.

**Prediction using MCP Research:**

To get a better prediction, let's ask Perplexity about the relative size and economic activity of these areas, focusing on relevant sectors.

```tool_code
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>researcher-mcp</server_name>
<tool_name>reason</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "query": "Compare the Dayton, OH metropolitan area and the Akron-Canton, OH metropolitan area. Which area has a larger population? Which has a more active economy, particularly regarding technology, web development, graphic design, and freelance/gig work? Based on these factors, would scraping Craigslist job/gig leads in both areas likely yield significantly more relevant leads than scraping only Dayton?"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

I will analyze Perplexity's response to provide a more educated guess on whether the 'small\_region' approach is likely to be substantially better than the 'single\_city' approach in the long run.

**Assistant:**

You're right to question that – let me clarify the A/B test structure we implemented based on our previous discussion and the limitations we discovered:

*   **Run A (Scope: Single City):** Targeted *only* the `dayton` Craigslist subdomain. (`--target-cities dayton`)
*   **Run B (Scope: Small Region):** Targeted *both* the `dayton` and `akroncanton` Craigslist subdomains. (`--target-cities dayton,akroncanton`)

The goal of this specific test was to compare the results of scraping **just Dayton** versus scraping **Dayton PLUS a nearby major area (Akron/Canton)** to see if expanding the geographic scope by adding another subdomain significantly increased the number of relevant leads found.

So, yes, Run B included an additional location (`akroncanton`) compared to Run A. This was the variable we were testing: the impact of the search *scope*.

Does this clarify the test setup, or were you envisioning a different kind of comparison?

```tool_code
<ask_followup_question>
<question>To clarify, the A/B test compared scraping *only* Dayton (Run A) against scraping *both* Dayton and Akron/Canton (Run B) to see if the wider scope found more leads.

**Assistant:**

Okay, let me explain.

1.  **The A/B Test We Ran:**
    *   We compared scraping *only* Dayton to scraping *both* Dayton and Akron/Canton.
    *   The result was: Dayton alone found 1 lead. Dayton + Akron/Canton found 1 *additional* lead (total 2 unique leads across both runs, but only 1 new one in the second run).
    *   This *suggests* that scraping the wider region might be slightly better, but the difference (just 1 lead) is too small to be sure from this single test.

2.  **The Perplexity Query I Proposed:**
    *   I wanted to ask Perplexity to compare the *general size and activity* (population, tech jobs, etc.) of Dayton vs. Akron/Canton.
    *   This information would help us *predict* if adding Akron/Canton *should* logically result in finding significantly more leads over time, even if our brief test only showed a small difference.

**Will this give us the answer?**

*   The A/B test gave us *real data* from your specific setup, but it was a very short test.
*   The Perplexity query will give us *context and prediction* based on general information about the cities.

**Together, the test results and the Perplexity analysis will give us a much better idea** of whether scraping the wider region (Dayton + Akron/Canton) is likely more effective than just scraping Dayton. It helps us interpret the small difference we saw in the test.

Shall I proceed with asking Perplexity to compare the Dayton and Akron-Canton areas now?

**User:**

[use_mcp_tool for 'researcher-mcp'] Result:
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a detailed comparison between the Dayton and Akron-Canton metropolitan areas, focusing on population size, economic activity in tech-related fields, and whether scraping Craigslist in both areas would yield more leads than just Dayton. 

First, I need to check the population data. From the search results, the Cleveland-Akron-Canton CSA (which includes Akron-Canton) has a 2023 estimate of 3,732,803 [1]. Dayton's CSA is listed at 1,086,998 [1]. So Akron-Canton is significantly larger. That answers the population part.

Next, economic activity, especially in tech, web development, graphic design, and freelance work. The sources mention that Akron's unemployment rate is higher than the state average (4.3% vs 3.7%) as of 2024 [2], which might indicate a more competitive job market. However, Columbus and Cincinnati have recovered jobs post-pandemic, while Akron, Cleveland, Dayton, etc., haven't [2]. But Huntington Bank's executive mentions Akron's wages are near the national average with a lower cost of living [2], which could attract remote workers. Dayton's economy is discussed in the Mercatus report, highlighting its historical manufacturing decline and challenges adapting to a service economy [3]. The Brookings report notes that Columbus has a more diversified economy, while Dayton relies more on sectors like Wright-Patterson Air Force Base [6][8]. 

Tech and gig work might be more present in larger metros. Akron's CSA being part of a larger combined statistical area (Cleveland-Akron-Canton) might offer more opportunities. The Huntington exec also mentions Akron's potential for attracting remote workers with a PR campaign [2], suggesting a growing gig economy. Dayton's growth areas include logistics due to highways and the Honda-LG plant [6], which might not directly relate to tech freelancing.

Looking at GDP, Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland are top in Ohio [8]. Akron and Dayton are in the top 100 US metros by GDP, but Columbus is leading in job growth. However, since the user is comparing Akron-Canton and Dayton, Akron's larger population and proximity to Cleveland (a larger economic hub) might give it an edge. The Brookings PDF also mentions that Central Ohio (Columbus) is dynamic, but that's not directly relevant here. 

For Craigslist scraping, larger populations usually mean more job postings. Akron-Canton's larger population and possible remote work initiatives could mean more gig opportunities. However, Dayton's specific industries might have niche postings. The user should consider both, but Akron-Canton might have more volume. Alternatives like focusing on Columbus or Cincinnati could yield even more leads, but the user specifically asked about Dayton vs. Akron-Canton.

Potential considerations: Local job boards beyond Craigslist, industry-specific sites, and the time sensitivity of scraping. Also, remote work trends might dilute location-specific postings. 

So, combining all this, the answer should outline population sizes, economic factors favoring Akron-Canton's larger and potentially more diverse gig economy, and recommend scraping both but noting that Akron-Canton might offer more leads. Alternatives could include expanding to other cities or using broader platforms.
</think>

### Comparison of Dayton, OH and Akron-Canton, OH Metropolitan Areas  

#### **1. Step-by-Step Reasoning**  
**Population Size**:  
- The **Akron-Canton, OH CSA** (Combined Statistical Area) includes Akron, Canton, and Cleveland, with a **2023 population estimate of 3,732,803**[1].  
- The **Dayton-Springfield-Kettering, OH CSA** has a **2023 population estimate of 1,086,998**[1].  
**Conclusion**: Akron-Canton’s CSA is over **3x larger** than Dayton’s CSA.  

**Economic Activity**:  
- **Akron-Canton**:  
  - Unemployment rate (4.3% in 2024) lags behind Ohio’s state average (3.7%)[2].  
  - Wages ($32.72/hr) near the national average ($34.57), with lower cost of living[2].  
  - Struggles with labor shortages but has seen growth in remote-work advocacy and downtown revitalization efforts[2].  
- **Dayton**:  
  - Historically reliant on manufacturing (e.g., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, automotive)[3][6].  
  - Home values increased 69.1% from 2011–2019, signaling economic recovery[5].  
  - Focused on logistics and supply chain industries due to proximity to I-70/I-75[6].  

**Tech and Freelance/Gig Work**:  
- **Akron-Canton**:  
  - Huntington Bank executives highlight untapped potential in remote-work recruitment[2].  
  - Proximity to Cleveland (a larger tech hub) may offer spillover opportunities.  
- **Dayton**:  
  - Limited tech/gig ecosystem; growth driven by defense and manufacturing[6][8].  
  - No major initiatives cited for freelance or tech-sector expansion in search results.  

---

#### **2. Key Considerations**  
- **Population Density**: Larger populations (Akron-Canton) often correlate with more job/gig postings.  
- **Economic Diversification**: Akron-Canton’s ties to Cleveland’s economy (healthcare, education) may foster more tech/gig roles vs. Dayton’s manufacturing/logistics focus.  
- **Remote Work Trends**: Akron’s push to attract remote workers[2] could increase freelance opportunities.  

---

#### **3. Relevant Examples**  
- **Akron**: PR campaigns targeting remote workers (e.g., “Move off the coast”)[2].  
- **Dayton**: Growth in logistics due to Honda–LG Energy battery plant[6].  

---

#### **4. Practical Implications**  
- **Craigslist Scraping**:
