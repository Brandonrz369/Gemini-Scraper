Therefore, I am starting a new business, but I need help. I need a kind, talented, and artistic person to help me with a website. Ideally, you would be someone who has an interest for the arts, vintage, antiques, etc. I am not looking for a cold, basic site. Can you help? I am able to help with internships and college credits if you put me in touch with professors, etc. If the image posted appeals to you- that is my style.",

We have 8 weeks if we start on april 6th to get this done. You can do the heavy lifting but coach me on simpler aspects of the painting. Open to watercolor/acrylic/oil etc. and style (realistic vs more impressionist etc.) size of painting, we can discuss all of it.\nPS. Im getting photoshop inquiries and to be clear this is an actual painting gig we are copying a picture I took onto canvas",
