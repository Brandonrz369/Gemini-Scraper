        "description": "Project Description: We are a small yet focused merchandise and branded apparel business with a dedicated team of five, processing approximately five to ten orders daily. Our operations support a variety of clients, and we are seeking an experienced consultant to help streamline and automate key processes. Currently, our workflows involve manual steps for inventory tracking, order releases, and invoicing. We’re eager to explore cost-effective, technology-driven solutions tailored to our needs and scale.\nWhile integration with a large client’s ERP system (via cXML PunchOut) is a potential future consideration, our immediate priority is automating internal workflows and improving our inventory and order management processes. If applicable, we are open to exploring integration solutions aligned with PunchOut protocols and PromoStandards. More information about PromoStandards can be found at PromoStandards.org.\nKey Project Goals: Analyze current workflows, particularly around inventory tracking and order releases.\nRecommend and assist in implementing software solutions for B2B e-commerce and inventory management.\nAutomate processes such as work order creation, inventory adjustments, and invoicing.\nExplore and recommend integration solutions like PunchOut protocols and PromoStandards, if applicable.\nExample Challenge: One specific process we aim to improve is our apparel release workflow, which is just one example of the broader services we provide to clients. Currently, we bulk produce items efficiently; however, inventory is manually entered into QuickBooks Desktop. When clients request a release, we manually create a \"work order\" in QuickBooks Desktop to fulfill the shipment, which also adjusts inventory. Shipping costs are then invoiced quarterly, as the products are prepaid on net terms. While this process works, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. We are looking for modern, technology-driven solutions to streamline these steps and enhance efficiency.\nIdeal Candidate: Strong expertise in B2B e-commerce platforms and inventory management systems.\nExperience with automation tools and API integrations to improve workflows.  Knowledge of solutions tailored to merchandise or apparel businesses.\nFamiliarity with tools like ShipStation, PunchOut capabilities, PromoStandards, and ERP systems (preferred but not mandatory).\nDeliverables: A detailed analysis of current processes with actionable recommendations for improvement.\nAssistance in selecting and implementing software or tools for B2B inventory and order management.\nRedesigned workflows to automate and optimize operations.\nSupport for transitioning to new tools or technologies with minimal disruption.\nBudget: Open to proposals based on the complexity and scope of the project.\nHow to Apply: Please include the following in your proposal:\nA summary of your experience with similar projects.\nExamples of tools or technologies you’ve implemented for B2B e-commerce or inventory management.\nAny experience with PunchOut, PromoStandards, or ERP integrations (if applicable).\nAn estimated timeline and cost for completion.\nSkills Required\neCommerce\nInventory Management\nWorkflow Consulting\nERP Software\nBusiness Consulting",

Basic familiarity with Twitter, Instragram, and Facebook a plus.  Familiarity with WordPress and/or online platforms (Soundcloud, Podbean, etc) are a bonus but not required.\nThis is a LIVE-IN and Barter position. You will work part-time doing graphic design for our websites, social media, and publishers. You’ll also do light Social Media postings and light office and administrative work—we manage a consultative referral service which we’ll train you how to operate.\nTo be clear, this is an Exchange and BARTER position. You will receive a Private Room and Board (valued at $1400/month) as compensation for part-time work. In return you'll get a nice, fairly large, private studio room with private bathroom and shower, all you can eat food (we buy your food twice a week), free internet, free onsite laundry, full use of an industrial/commercial kitchen, and free parking all set within a very cool bohemian atmosphere in our fairly large Temple City location. We are in an upscale area with plenty of restaurants, parks, shops, and public transit nodes all within walking distance. You’ll be a part of a community of professionals: artists, technologists, writers, graphic designers, videographers, and business types that work together in a communal space.\nEven though this is a Barter position, there are different opportunities to earn income ($10 -$35/hour and more) working with us. There is also the potential for advancement here.  But, if you just want to only do the barter/work exchange than that is fine as well (no pressure).\nTO APPLY FOR THE POSITION: PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING\nPlease send a resume, 3 - 5 graphic design samples, your social media links and a well-written personal email about why you feel you fit this position to the CL relay email address:\nPlease be sure to include your contact number and direct email address.\nQuestions?

We will be mixing CGI shots and some video game footage to actual camera shots on RED KOMODO so it is important to be able to smooth out color pallets and keep a uniform look. Sadly we all know Hollywood is in it's death throws, but some of us are still committed to making films in SoCal. Again being a small 'micro-studio' we have to make sure we can do a lot with a small budget. But also looking for people to create a team as we have other projects in the pipeline. All I can say is that I'm very easy to work with and have produced and written other feature films that are distributed so once we have met happy to share more on the project and my credits. This is a real ad. Also if you are looking for your first colorist credit - happy to talk more. Thanks for reading.",
