PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)

**Assistant:**

<plan_mode_respond>
<response>You are persistent! Let me reconsider based on the file paths I've seen. You might be referring to the configuration file for the extension itself, potentially located at a path like `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`.

**If** the primary API key used by the extension is stored within that JSON file (or a similar accessible file), then **theoretically**, it might be possible to *edit* that file using my tools (`read_file`, `replace_in_file`).

**However, there are significant practical challenges to making this *fully autonomous*:**

1.  **Error Detection:** I don't automatically receive structured error messages when *my own* API calls fail due to rate limits or invalid keys. The extension handles that communication with the AI provider. I would only know if *you* explicitly tell me, "Cline, your API key seems to have hit a limit."
2.  **Key Storage:** To cycle keys, you would need to provide me with a list of alternative API keys. We would need a place to store this list. Perhaps we could add a new section within the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file itself to hold these alternate keys?
3.  **Applying the Change:** Even if I successfully edit the settings file to insert a new key, the VS Code extension would likely need to be **reloaded or restarted** to actually start *using* that new key. This reload is something **I cannot trigger myself**; it would require manual action from you (e.g., using the "Developer: Reload Window" command in VS Code) or potentially restarting VS Code entirely.

**So, while I *might* be able to edit the file containing the key, the process cannot be fully automated end-to-end by me alone.** It would require you to monitor for errors related to my API key and manually reload the extension after I edit the file.

**Revised Plan Option (Semi-Automated Key Cycling):**

1.  **Implement Checkpointing, Error Handling, US City List, Search Refinements:** Proceed with these steps as planned previously.
2.  **Store Alternate Keys:** If you provide a list of alternate API keys, I can attempt to add them to the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file (e.g., under a new `clineApiKeys` list).
3.  **Manual Trigger for Swap:** If *my* operations fail and you inform me it's likely an API key limit, I can then attempt to:
    *   Read `cline_mcp_settings.json`.
    *   Find the next available key from the stored list.
    *   Use `replace_in_file` to update the *active* key field in the settings file.
    *   **Inform you** that I've updated the key and that you need to **reload the VS Code window** for the change to take effect.
4.  **Start/Resume Scan:** Once you confirm the reload, I can proceed with the scan.

This is the closest I can get to automating the key cycling. It still requires your intervention to detect the error and reload the extension.

Is this semi-automated approach acceptable, or should we stick to the plan without attempting key cycling for the extension itself?</response>

**Assistant:**

<plan_mode_respond>
<response>Okay, I understand. We will first focus on implementing all the other planned improvements for the US-wide scan:
1.  Checkpointing/Resumption logic.
2.  Robust error handling review.
3.  Getting and integrating the full US city list.
4.  Refining search terms.
5.  Setting up for autonomous execution (minimal approvals).
6.  Starting the scan.

**After** these steps are completed and the main scan is potentially running, we will then treat the problem of automating the Cline extension's API key cycling (detecting limits, storing keys, triggering reloads) as a **separate, subsequent task**. Tackling that complex issue requires a different approach, possibly involving helper scripts or even designing a dedicated MCP server, which we can explore once the primary scraping enhancements are done.

Does this sequence sound good? Implement the scraper improvements and start the scan first, then address the extension's key cycling automation later?

If yes, please ask me to "toggle to Act mode" so I can begin implementing the checkpointing logic in `StateManager`.</response>

**Assistant:**

<plan_mode_respond>
<response>Understood. After implementing all the planned enhancements (checkpointing, US city list, refined search terms, etc.), I will run a test scan targeting a small subset of the US cities first to ensure everything works correctly before launching the full scan. I will use a minimum of 8 workers for the multiprocessing pool as requested (adjusting based on available CPU cores if necessary). If the test scan encounters errors, I will attempt to debug and fix them before proceeding with the full US scan.

**Assistant:**

<plan_mode_respond>
<response>I understand you want maximum autonomy for this entire process.

Regarding the auto-approval limit: I will set `requires_approval=false` for all the steps involved in implementing the plan we've discussed (editing the Python files, using the MCP server for research, running the test scan, and starting the final scan using the virtual environment). These actions are generally considered safe within the project's context.

While I will operate with the intention of full autonomy for this sequence based on your consent, I cannot definitively guarantee there isn't an underlying system limit on consecutive auto-approved actions beyond my control. However, I will proceed with the plan and execute the steps sequentially without asking for approval for each one.

Let's start the implementation. Please ask me to "toggle to Act mode".</response>

**Assistant:**

<plan_mode_respond>
<response>I don't have specific information confirming a hard limit of exactly 25 consecutive auto-approved tool uses. My operational guidelines focus on setting `requires_approval` based on the nature of the command (safe vs. potentially impactful).

For the plan we've outlined (implementing checkpointing, getting the city list, refining search terms, running the scan), the vast majority of steps involve editing local project files or running the Python script within the virtual environment, which are generally considered safe operations. I will set `requires_approval=false` for these steps as you've requested, aiming for maximum autonomy.

While I will proceed with this approach, complex, long-running tasks can sometimes encounter unexpected situations or edge cases that might still require clarification or intervention, regardless of the approval settings. I will do my best to execute the entire sequence autonomously based on your consent.

Shall we proceed? Please ask me to "toggle to Act mode" to begin.</response>

**Assistant:**

Okay, I am now in ACT MODE and will proceed with the implementation autonomously, setting `requires_approval=false` for the planned steps.

**Step 1: Implement Checkpointing/Resumption Logic**

**1a. Modify `StateManager` to add checkpointing functions.**

I will add `get_last_completed_city` and `set_last_completed_city` methods to `backend/modules/state_manager.py`. I will also ensure the `search_scope` column migration logic added previously is still present.

Now that you have the latest state of the file, try the operation again with fewer/more precise SEARCH blocks.
(If you run into this error 3 times in a row, you may use the write_to_file tool as a fallback. Keep in mind, the write_to_file fallback is far from ideal, as this means you'll be re-writing the entire contents of the file just to make a few edits, which takes time and money. So let's bias towards using replace_in_file as effectively as possible)

**Assistant:**

You are absolutely correct. My apologies. The error message indicates that the `replace_in_file` command failed because the file `backend/modules/state_manager.py` *already contains* the changes I was trying to make (the `get_last_completed_city` and `set_last_completed_city` methods). This means the previous edits were successful, and the file is already correctly set up for the state manager part of the checkpointing.

My mistake was trying to re-apply changes that were already present.

**Step 1b: Modify `main.py` to use the checkpointing functions.**

Now I need to modify `main.py` to:
1.  Get the last completed city from the `StateManager` at the start.
2.  Filter the list of cities to process, skipping those already completed.
3.  Save the city code as the last completed city *after* its corresponding worker process finishes successfully.

First, I'll read the current state of `main.py`.

```tool_code
<read_file>
<path>backend/main.py</path>
</read_file>
```
