                <td class="description" title="Project Description: We are a small yet focused merchandise and branded apparel business with a dedicated team of five, processing approximately five to ten orders daily. Our operations support a variety of clients, and we are seeking an experienced consultant to help streamline and automate key processes. Currently, our workflows involve manual steps for inventory tracking, order releases, and invoicing. We’re eager to explore cost-effective, technology-driven solutions tailored to our needs and scale.
While integration with a large client’s ERP system (via cXML PunchOut) is a potential future consideration, our immediate priority is automating internal workflows and improving our inventory and order management processes. If applicable, we are open to exploring integration solutions aligned with PunchOut protocols and PromoStandards. More information about PromoStandards can be found at PromoStandards.org.
Key Project Goals: Analyze current workflows, particularly around inventory tracking and order releases.
Recommend and assist in implementing software solutions for B2B e-commerce and inventory management.
Automate processes such as work order creation, inventory adjustments, and invoicing.
Explore and recommend integration solutions like PunchOut protocols and PromoStandards, if applicable.
Example Challenge: One specific process we aim to improve is our apparel release workflow, which is just one example of the broader services we provide to clients. Currently, we bulk produce items efficiently; however, inventory is manually entered into QuickBooks Desktop. When clients request a release, we manually create a "work order" in QuickBooks Desktop to fulfill the shipment, which also adjusts inventory. Shipping costs are then invoiced quarterly, as the products are prepaid on net terms. While this process works, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. We are looking for modern, technology-driven solutions to streamline these steps and enhance efficiency.
Ideal Candidate: Strong expertise in B2B e-commerce platforms and inventory management systems.
Experience with automation tools and API integrations to improve workflows.  Knowledge of solutions tailored to merchandise or apparel businesses.
Familiarity with tools like ShipStation, PunchOut capabilities, PromoStandards, and ERP systems (preferred but not mandatory).
Deliverables: A detailed analysis of current processes with actionable recommendations for improvement.
Assistance in selecting and implementing software or tools for B2B inventory and order management.
Redesigned workflows to automate and optimize operations.

Business Consulting">Project Description: We are a small yet focused merchandise and branded apparel business with a dedicated team of five, processing approximately five to ten orders daily. Our operations support a variety of clients, and we are seeking an experienced consultant to help streamline and automate key processes. Currently, our workflows involve manual steps for inventory tracking, order releases, and invoicing. We’re eager to explore cost-effective, technology-driven solutions tailored to our needs and scale.
While integration with a large client’s ERP system (via cXML PunchOut) is a potential future consideration, our immediate priority is automating internal workflows and improving our inventory and order management processes. If applicable, we are open to exploring integration solutions aligned with PunchOut protocols and PromoStandards. More information about PromoStandards can be found at PromoStandards.org.
Key Project Goals: Analyze current workflows, particularly around inventory tracking and order releases.
Recommend and assist in implementing software solutions for B2B e-commerce and inventory management.
Automate processes such as work order creation, inventory adjustments, and invoicing.
Explore and recommend integration solutions like PunchOut protocols and PromoStandards, if applicable.
Example Challenge: One specific process we aim to improve is our apparel release workflow, which is just one example of the broader services we provide to clients. Currently, we bulk produce items efficiently; however, inventory is manually entered into QuickBooks Desktop. When clients request a release, we manually create a "work order" in QuickBooks Desktop to fulfill the shipment, which also adjusts inventory. Shipping costs are then invoiced quarterly, as the products are prepaid on net terms. While this process works, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. We are looking for modern, technology-driven solutions to streamline these steps and enhance efficiency.
Ideal Candidate: Strong expertise in B2B e-commerce platforms and inventory management systems.
Experience with automation tools and API integrations to improve workflows.  Knowledge of solutions tailored to merchandise or apparel businesses.
Familiarity with tools like ShipStation, PunchOut capabilities, PromoStandards, and ERP systems (preferred but not mandatory).
Deliverables: A detailed analysis of current processes with actionable recommendations for improvement.
Assistance in selecting and implementing software or tools for B2B inventory and order management.
Redesigned workflows to automate and optimize operations.
Support for transitioning to new tools or technologies with minimal disruption.
Budget: Open to proposals based on the complexity and scope of the project.

The image I have attached shows some of the data I need however it is not professional, branded, or representative of the level of quality my company has to offer.

                <td class="description" title="Project Gig: WordPress Creation Consulting for Classified Listing Website
Looking for an experienced WordPress (theme) website creator to consult with while setting up a classified listing website. This is a project-based gig with flexibility in hours and based on our experience, the potential for similar projects in the future.
What I’m Looking For:
Someone with hands-on experience building classified listing or directory websites using WordPress. If you do not have any directory type website experience to show me then I would prefer that you did not respond to this ad. I'm want to see your work and will be validating with the website owner your involvement with the site creation.
*This isn’t about a full-time job or long-term employment—just help with getting this specific project off the ground, with the possibility to collaborate on more projects down the line.
*No degree required, but real-world experience in building these types of websites is essential.
*My real preference is that you are located in central North Carolina, but not a deal breaker.
What You’ll Be Doing:
*Providing consultation during the set-up process of classified listing websites on WordPress.
*Directing me as needed to implement key features, ensuring it’s user-friendly and optimized.
*If all goes well, serious consideration will be given for ongoing management of the site.
*Potential for ongoing projects if things go well, as we do have plans to scale.
Why You Should Consider This Opportunity:
*Flexible hours—work around your schedule.
*Potential for future projects—this is a startup, so there's more work to come if things go well.
*You’ll be working with me directly, so you should be ok with scheduled Q&A face to face zoom calls as needed.
If this sounds like a project you'd be interested in, send over your contact info and a portfolio of past classified or directory websites you've worked on. Let’s talk details and see if we’re a good match!">Project Gig: WordPress Creation Consulting for Classified Listing Website

We’re seeking a Graphic Designer who is familiar with Adobe Photoshop and other graphics programs.  Basic familiarity with Twitter, Instragram, and Facebook a plus.  Familiarity with WordPress and/or online platforms (Soundcloud, Podbean, etc) are a bonus but not required.
This is a LIVE-IN and Barter position. You will work part-time doing graphic design for our websites, social media, and publishers. You’ll also do light Social Media postings and light office and administrative work—we manage a consultative referral service which we’ll train you how to operate.
To be clear, this is an Exchange and BARTER position. You will receive a Private Room and Board (valued at $1400/month) as compensation for part-time work. In return you'll get a nice, fairly large, private studio room with private bathroom and shower, all you can eat food (we buy your food twice a week), free internet, free onsite laundry, full use of an industrial/commercial kitchen, and free parking all set within a very cool bohemian atmosphere in our fairly large Temple City location. We are in an upscale area with plenty of restaurants, parks, shops, and public transit nodes all within walking distance. You’ll be a part of a community of professionals: artists, technologists, writers, graphic designers, videographers, and business types that work together in a communal space.
Even though this is a Barter position, there are different opportunities to earn income ($10 -$35/hour and more) working with us. There is also the potential for advancement here.  But, if you just want to only do the barter/work exchange than that is fine as well (no pressure).
TO APPLY FOR THE POSITION: PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING
Please send a resume, 3 - 5 graphic design samples, your social media links and a well-written personal email about why you feel you fit this position to the CL relay email address:

We want someone who is super comfortable capturing content on their own device(s) and who has the ability to utilize multiple platforms to create finished content. This might entail 5 hours/week and some weeks (when we’re capturing content) might mean 15 hours/week. The schedule can be flexible, but we’d like to work a month in advance (producing Feb content in Jan, etc).
We’re not looking for someone with extensive experience, just someone who is really creative and talented. If you’re interested in this role, please reply with a resume and point us to social media accounts that you’ve worked on. Including previous examples of your work would be fantastic.">We are a small, busy local spa that specializes in natural nail care and skincare treatments.

So the video would not be longer than 2 to 3 minutes of time.  We can agree up front what you would charge for this AI video development.  Thank you, Paul.">I am looking for a college student or someone with experience with AI Video development like on Leonardo AI website that can develop specific Christian-themed video to my gospel songs.

I have a developed style with my music and my fashion but am intimidated/allergic when it comes to social media and not good at executing or presenting.
The ideal candidate would have a decent social media presence themselves as well (but not required) and has an aesthetic in the same ballpark as mine so that we are basically speaking as close to the same language as possible.
The artists with whom I most harmonize aesthetically and sonically are Clairo, Hotel Ugly, Still Woozy, The Marias, Omar Apollo etc.

Pay is $30 an hour cash and will start out needing several hours and may then also need more hours later.

I am a rank beginner nor artistically included. We have 8 weeks if we start on april 6th to get this done. You can do the heavy lifting but coach me on simpler aspects of the painting. Open to watercolor/acrylic/oil etc. and style (realistic vs more impressionist etc.) size of painting, we can discuss all of it.
