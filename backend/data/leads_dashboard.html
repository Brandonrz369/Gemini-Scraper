Then unsnap the battery where it is connected to the circuitboard at the lower right corner of the battery.

                <td class="description" title="Hackingtons is a code school for kids with locations throughout Northern CA and we're looking for instructors who have outgoing and kid-friendly personalities. We teach HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Python/Unity to kids ages 8 - 15. We are looking for instructors for our location in Rocklin.
The curriculum is fully created and maintained by our development team. It is self-paced and the instructors are there to motivate, keep kids on task, breakdown complex concepts, help debug, inspire and have fun.
Instructors need to have programming knowledge in some of the languages taught. We do offer paid training time to study the curriculum and brush up on programming areas as needed. However, they need to have a good grasp of the basics. Good communication skills with parents is helpful, but more important is communicating well with the kids.
This is a great job for students, freelancers and recent graduates in transition. While we do periodically have full time openings, we strongly support our part-time employees looking for career engineering jobs. We have provided more references and recommendations for employees who ultimately left for full time positions than we care to count.
Starting part-time compensation is $23 - $26 per hour for lead instructors, $20 - $23 per hour for assistant instructors. Assistant instructors will be paired with a lead instructor, where a lead instructor can run their own small classes. That said, most classes have 2 - 3 instructors once established. Weekday classes are in the after school timeframe (3:15 pm - 7:10 pm) or Saturdays (9 am - 1 pm). Classes are small, we generally carry an average ratio of between 4 - 5 students to 1 instructor. Right now our primary shift open is for Saturday AMs, but new shifts open up with some regularity.
While the instructors need to be reliable, there can be some flexibility to the scheduling. Ideally, we find days and sets of classes that work for the instructors' schedule and hold to these with minimal week-to-week variance.
Because instructors work closely with children, we do conduct background checks.
To apply, please send a resume and an introduction. Thank you.">Hackingtons is a code school for kids with locations throughout Northern CA and we're looking for instructors who have outgoing and kid-friendly personalities.

                <td class="description" title="Hackingtons is a code school for kids with locations throughout Northern CA and we're looking for instructors who have outgoing and kid-friendly personalities. We teach HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Python/Unity to kids ages 8 - 15. We are looking for instructors for our location in Rocklin.
The curriculum is fully created and maintained by our development team. It is self-paced and the instructors are there to motivate, keep kids on task, breakdown complex concepts, help debug, inspire and have fun.
Instructors need to have programming knowledge in some of the languages taught. We do offer paid training time to study the curriculum and brush up on programming areas as needed. However, they need to have a good grasp of the basics. Good communication skills with parents is helpful, but more important is communicating well with the kids.
This is a great job for students, freelancers and recent graduates in transition. While we do periodically have full time openings, we strongly support our part-time employees looking for career engineering jobs. We have provided more references and recommendations for employees who ultimately left for full time positions than we care to count.
Starting part-time compensation is $23 - $26 per hour for lead instructors, $20 - $23 per hour for assistant instructors. Assistant instructors will be paired with a lead instructor, where a lead instructor can run their own small classes. That said, most classes have 2 - 3 instructors once established. Weekday classes are in the after school timeframe (3:15 pm - 7:10 pm) or Saturdays (9 am - 1 pm). Classes are small, we generally carry an average ratio of between 4 - 5 students to 1 instructor. Right now our primary shift open is for Saturday AMs, but new shifts open up with some regularity.
While the instructors need to be reliable, there can be some flexibility to the scheduling. Ideally, we find days and sets of classes that work for the instructors' schedule and hold to these with minimal week-to-week variance.
Because instructors work closely with children, we do conduct background checks.
To apply, please send a resume and an introduction. Thank you.">Hackingtons is a code school for kids with locations throughout Northern CA and we're looking for instructors who have outgoing and kid-friendly personalities.

                <td class="description" title="Hackingtons is a code school for kids with locations throughout Northern CA and we're looking for instructors who have outgoing and kid-friendly personalities. We teach HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Python/Unity to kids ages 8 - 15. We are looking for instructors for our new location in Brentwood.
The curriculum is fully created and maintained by our development team. It is self-paced and the instructors are there to motivate, keep kids on task, breakdown complex concepts, help debug, inspire and have fun.
Instructors need to have programming knowledge in some of the languages taught. We do offer paid training time to study the curriculum and brush up on programming areas as needed. However, they need to have a good grasp of the basics. Good communication skills with parents is helpful, but more important is communicating well with the kids.
This is a great job for students, freelancers and recent graduates in transition. While we do periodically have full time openings, we strongly support our part-time employees looking for career engineering jobs. We have provided more references and recommendations for employees who ultimately left for full time positions than we care to count.
Starting part-time compensation is $23 - $26 per hour for lead instructors, $20 - $23 per hour for assistant instructors. Assistant instructors will be paired with a lead instructor, where a lead instructor can run their own small classes. That said, most classes have 2 - 3 instructors once established. Weekday classes are in the after school timeframe (3:15 pm - 7:10 pm) or Saturdays (9 am - 1 pm). Classes are small, we generally carry an average ratio of between 4 - 5 students to 1 instructor.
While the instructors need to be reliable, there can be some flexibility to the scheduling. Ideally, we find days and sets of classes that work for the instructors' schedule and hold to these with minimal week-to-week variance.
Because instructors work closely with children, we do conduct background checks.
To apply, please send a resume and an introduction. Thank you.">Hackingtons is a code school for kids with locations throughout Northern CA and we're looking for instructors who have outgoing and kid-friendly personalities.

We have ambitious plans for IXL, and we’re looking for the right people to make them happen.
This is a full-time position in our San Mateo, CA headquarters office. The work schedule for this role is Monday-Friday in the office with the option to work from home one day per week.
You’ll:
Contribute to IXL product strategy in a team that includes our CEO, COO, and VP of Product (we’re all product people)
Create outstanding product designs and be able to work independently
Collaborate with engineering and other teams to turn ideas into reality
You must be highly creative, analytical, and intuitive. You should have at least 5 years of relevant work experience, with at least a couple years in a product manager role.
IXL is different, and you’ll need an open mind. If you have beliefs about how product management is done, based on experiences at other tech companies, you must be willing to abandon them. We probably don’t do it the way you’re used to.
Great product managers often come from unexpected places. If this sounds like a role you’d excel at, but you don’t have the typical background, we’re open to being convinced.
