3,,Convert photo to painting (several $100 gig),https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/crg/d/new-york-convert-photo-to-painting/7839967960.html,2025-04-04T19:06:27-0400,crg,"I want to make a painting out of a photo I took and gift it to someone.
But i want to be part of the creation process so this job will involve me providing the supplies (lmk what you need eg paint, canvas; i will send you the pic and we can discuss), and then we make it together.
I am a rank beginner nor artistically included. We have 8 weeks if we start on april 6th to get this done. You can do the heavy lifting but coach me on simpler aspects of the painting. Open to watercolor/acrylic/oil etc. and style (realistic vs more impressionist etc.) size of painting, we can discuss all of it.
PS. Im getting photoshop inquiries and to be clear this is an actual painting gig we are copying a picture I took onto canvas",,Reply Button,,0,,2025-04-06T09:12:33.972993,,,
