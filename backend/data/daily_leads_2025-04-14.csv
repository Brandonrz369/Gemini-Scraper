I'm a Certified Holistic Health Practitioner, Nutritionist, Hypnotherapist. I'm looking for someone who's familiar with the natural healing industry and would know how to find me targeted clients. I would only need you to land me 4 per month, but you can get me more and make more money. These clients can be anywhere in the US, as I do my sessions with them over Zoom.
I offer clients a free 30-minute consultation, and then once they sign up for my program, I offer them an ""8 Weeks to Healing"" program, for which I charge the $3000.
You'll earn $500 per client for the first 4 clients in any given month, and then you'd earn $750 per client for anything after 4 clients for any given month. This is commission only until you can help me get just 4 clients, and I would then start paying you a set retainer amount each month, unless of course you wanted to keep it at a commission. That would be up to you. I'd also be open to working out a combination of a set retainer amount plus commission, which would of course be less than if it was commission only.
Lastly, please note that I'm placing this ad due to the fact that I cannot afford to pay regular marketing rates until I get at least 4 clients, so please, no big marketing companies. I'm only looking for an individual who knows how to market something like this without all the costly, fancy stuff. If there is a cost on your part, I can cover it as long as it's reasonable. I don't want you to have to come out of pocket.

This is an encyclopedic compilation and compendium of humorous quips, quotes, witticisms, jokes, thoughts, and one-liners for the not-so-serious entertainer, speaker, and writer. The reference is over 2400 pages of standard Word text.
Typically, the subscribers would search by first using the Table of Contents and then proceed to any topic of interest. It should also have a word search feature like we might find in a Word document or an e-book. Most importantly I would like to protect the contents as a whole from being easily copied. Subscribers must be able to copy a reasonable amount of material for their personal use. So, am looking for your best suggestions as to how we might effectively accomplish this. The document must be user friendly while at the same time perhaps limiting the viewing screen or amount of allowed use during a specific time period. Maybe it should be limited in the number of lines that can be viewed before moving to the following pages. Another possibility is limiting the number of entries (gags and jokes) a subscriber could view in a given time period. We will need to discuss your ideas.
The website would also be used for initially signing up new customers using PayPal or credit cards. We must also be able to track exactly when new user’s subscriptions will expire and send a couple reminders to them prior to that date. The length of a subscription is still being considered (one month or one year?).
Please send me your suggestions on the structure of the site, anticipated costs, and how to best proceed.  Thank you…",,Reply Button,,0,,2025-04-13T17:50:44.974517,,,

I plan to conduct one more intense marketing push for the next 2 years to get the company ready to sell in early 2027.
I need help with SEO, social media, and anything else that makes good sense these days.
Here’s the gig. I’m not going to pay the expert that I select a flat rate to perform X amount of tasks and I’m not going to pay an hourly rate.
The way I will compensate the person I choose will be by commission. My product’s price range is between $2,700 to 3,500. We’ve sold over 5000 over the years and have NEVER had a return (seriously). This method of compensation will be MUCH MORE lucrative for the right person than a job/hourly rate.
I have a mistake proof tracking system that will direct all appropriate commissions to the person responsible.
Piquarium is a multiple award winning product that is manufactured in Northern California.
I need someone that I can partner with that is very confident in their abilities and that isn’t afraid to put a little skin (time) in the game for a much better return than an hourly rate or job rate. Each unit we sell because of your efforts will put money in your pocket.
If you have the expertise and the confidence to want to discuss further, please spend some time on my website www.piquarium.com and get to know my product a little bit. Then, if interested in furthering the conversation, send me an email with a paragraph stating your interest and your experience, and if we end up working together, we will figure out a commission percentage based on your experience and creativity.
My company will obviously pay for any ads/fees that are needed.

We need creative, high-quality work that captures our unapologetic vibe and resonates with our audience. Each design pays $100, with potential for ongoing collaboration if we click. Here’s what we’re looking for:
1. “Piss Up a Rope” Shirt
Concept: Our host’s favorite troll-slaying catchphrase—think funny, edgy, and bold.
Design Goals: Playful typography (cartoonish or handwritten) paired with a humorous graphic—like a rope twisting comically or a cheeky troll face. Keep it light, not crude. Use bright colors (yellow, green, blue) on a black base for a positive yet striking look. Center it on the chest or wrap it dynamically with the rope.
Vibe: Reflects the host’s no-nonsense attitude and livestream banter.
2. Military/Camo Logo Redesign
Concept: Reimagine our Off Topic Show logo with a rugged, tactical edge
Design Goals: Keep the logo’s core elements but infuse a military/camo aesthetic—think gritty textures, muted greens, or bold stencil fonts. Perfect for fans who love a tough, standout style.
Bonus Project: “LOSER” Redesign (Optional Pitch)
Current Design: Black shirt, “LOSER” in white graffiti-style font with a green “N.”
Design Goals: Elevate the street-art feel—try neon or metallic text, add doodles (skulls, scratches), or switch to a distressed block style. Maybe hint at my “Hollywood” tattoo with a star or palm tree. Stretch it across the chest or scale it creatively.
Details:
Both shirts will live on StayHighlyPositive.com, tying into my brand and content.
Pay is $100 per design, with room for more projects if we vibe.
Take creative risks—mockups encouraged! If you need more brand specifics, just ask.

My profiles aren’t tragic—they’re fine, I swear,
But they’re missing the magic, that coastal flair.
I’m calling on someone who gets my scene,
A beachside muse with an artistic sheen.
What I Dream Of:
An Instagram Refresh that mirrors my space,
Where ocean breezes and art find their place.
Think sunlit corners, vibrant hues, and ease,
A vibe that whispers sophistication and seas.
A dating profile revamp that truly reflects,
How I live and dress, with elegant effects.
From creative charm to effortless grace,
Help me craft a profile that feels like my space.
I need a Wizard for Words, a playful touch,
To keep convos engaging but never too much.
A Wardrobe Glow-Up that echoes my art,
Flowing fabrics and coastal chic, a living work of heart.
And a Photo Shoot Guru to capture it all,
Moments that shimmer, like waves in a hall.
Who You Are:
You’re a master of vibes, your style on fire,
Blending creativity with what I aspire.
You know how to weave a story divine,
From the way I live to the clothes that shine.
This isn’t a makeover—it’s beachside finesse,
It’s amplifying the beauty of how I dress,
How I live, how I breathe, how my art takes flight,
Reflecting my world in its perfect light.

Our operations support a variety of clients, and we are seeking an experienced consultant to help streamline and automate key processes. Currently, our workflows involve manual steps for inventory tracking, order releases, and invoicing. We’re eager to explore cost-effective, technology-driven solutions tailored to our needs and scale.
While integration with a large client’s ERP system (via cXML PunchOut) is a potential future consideration, our immediate priority is automating internal workflows and improving our inventory and order management processes. If applicable, we are open to exploring integration solutions aligned with PunchOut protocols and PromoStandards. More information about PromoStandards can be found at PromoStandards.org.
Key Project Goals: Analyze current workflows, particularly around inventory tracking and order releases.
Recommend and assist in implementing software solutions for B2B e-commerce and inventory management.
Automate processes such as work order creation, inventory adjustments, and invoicing.
Explore and recommend integration solutions like PunchOut protocols and PromoStandards, if applicable.
Example Challenge: One specific process we aim to improve is our apparel release workflow, which is just one example of the broader services we provide to clients. Currently, we bulk produce items efficiently; however, inventory is manually entered into QuickBooks Desktop. When clients request a release, we manually create a ""work order"" in QuickBooks Desktop to fulfill the shipment, which also adjusts inventory. Shipping costs are then invoiced quarterly, as the products are prepaid on net terms. While this process works, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. We are looking for modern, technology-driven solutions to streamline these steps and enhance efficiency.
Ideal Candidate: Strong expertise in B2B e-commerce platforms and inventory management systems.
Experience with automation tools and API integrations to improve workflows.  Knowledge of solutions tailored to merchandise or apparel businesses.
Familiarity with tools like ShipStation, PunchOut capabilities, PromoStandards, and ERP systems (preferred but not mandatory).
Deliverables: A detailed analysis of current processes with actionable recommendations for improvement.
Assistance in selecting and implementing software or tools for B2B inventory and order management.
Redesigned workflows to automate and optimize operations.
Support for transitioning to new tools or technologies with minimal disruption.
Budget: Open to proposals based on the complexity and scope of the project.
How to Apply: Please include the following in your proposal:
A summary of your experience with similar projects.
Examples of tools or technologies you’ve implemented for B2B e-commerce or inventory management.
