Our operations support a variety of clients, and we are seeking an experienced consultant to help streamline and automate key processes. Currently, our workflows involve manual steps for inventory tracking, order releases, and invoicing. We’re eager to explore cost-effective, technology-driven solutions tailored to our needs and scale.
While integration with a large client’s ERP system (via cXML PunchOut) is a potential future consideration, our immediate priority is automating internal workflows and improving our inventory and order management processes. If applicable, we are open to exploring integration solutions aligned with PunchOut protocols and PromoStandards. More information about PromoStandards can be found at PromoStandards.org.
Key Project Goals: Analyze current workflows, particularly around inventory tracking and order releases.
Recommend and assist in implementing software solutions for B2B e-commerce and inventory management.
Automate processes such as work order creation, inventory adjustments, and invoicing.
Explore and recommend integration solutions like PunchOut protocols and PromoStandards, if applicable.
Example Challenge: One specific process we aim to improve is our apparel release workflow, which is just one example of the broader services we provide to clients. Currently, we bulk produce items efficiently; however, inventory is manually entered into QuickBooks Desktop. When clients request a release, we manually create a ""work order"" in QuickBooks Desktop to fulfill the shipment, which also adjusts inventory. Shipping costs are then invoiced quarterly, as the products are prepaid on net terms. While this process works, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. We are looking for modern, technology-driven solutions to streamline these steps and enhance efficiency.
Ideal Candidate: Strong expertise in B2B e-commerce platforms and inventory management systems.
Experience with automation tools and API integrations to improve workflows.  Knowledge of solutions tailored to merchandise or apparel businesses.
Familiarity with tools like ShipStation, PunchOut capabilities, PromoStandards, and ERP systems (preferred but not mandatory).
Deliverables: A detailed analysis of current processes with actionable recommendations for improvement.
Assistance in selecting and implementing software or tools for B2B inventory and order management.
Redesigned workflows to automate and optimize operations.
Support for transitioning to new tools or technologies with minimal disruption.
Budget: Open to proposals based on the complexity and scope of the project.
How to Apply: Please include the following in your proposal:
A summary of your experience with similar projects.
Examples of tools or technologies you’ve implemented for B2B e-commerce or inventory management.

*Directing me as needed to implement key features, ensuring it’s user-friendly and optimized.
*If all goes well, serious consideration will be given for ongoing management of the site.

Why You Should Consider This Opportunity:
*Flexible hours—work around your schedule.
*Potential for future projects—this is a startup, so there's more work to come if things go well.
*You’ll be working with me directly, so you should be ok with scheduled Q&A face to face zoom calls as needed.

But i want to be part of the creation process so this job will involve me providing the supplies (lmk what you need eg paint, canvas; i will send you the pic and we can discuss), and then we make it together.
I am a rank beginner nor artistically included. We have 8 weeks if we start on april 6th to get this done. You can do the heavy lifting but coach me on simpler aspects of the painting. Open to watercolor/acrylic/oil etc. and style (realistic vs more impressionist etc.) size of painting, we can discuss all of it.
PS. Im getting photoshop inquiries and to be clear this is an actual painting gig we are copying a picture I took onto canvas",,Reply Button,,0,,2025-04-06T09:12:33.972993,,,
