We teach HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Python/Unity to kids ages 8 - 15. We are looking for instructors for our location in Rocklin.
The curriculum is fully created and maintained by our development team. It is self-paced and the instructors are there to motivate, keep kids on task, breakdown complex concepts, help debug, inspire and have fun.
Instructors need to have programming knowledge in some of the languages taught. We do offer paid training time to study the curriculum and brush up on programming areas as needed. However, they need to have a good grasp of the basics. Good communication skills with parents is helpful, but more important is communicating well with the kids.
This is a great job for students, freelancers and recent graduates in transition. While we do periodically have full time openings, we strongly support our part-time employees looking for career engineering jobs. We have provided more references and recommendations for employees who ultimately left for full time positions than we care to count.
Starting part-time compensation is $23 - $26 per hour for lead instructors, $20 - $23 per hour for assistant instructors. Assistant instructors will be paired with a lead instructor, where a lead instructor can run their own small classes. That said, most classes have 2 - 3 instructors once established. Weekday classes are in the after school timeframe (3:15 pm - 7:10 pm) or Saturdays (9 am - 1 pm). Classes are small, we generally carry an average ratio of between 4 - 5 students to 1 instructor. Right now our primary shift open is for Saturday AMs, but new shifts open up with some regularity.
While the instructors need to be reliable, there can be some flexibility to the scheduling. Ideally, we find days and sets of classes that work for the instructors' schedule and hold to these with minimal week-to-week variance.
Because instructors work closely with children, we do conduct background checks.
