But i want to be part of the creation process so this job will involve me providing the supplies (lmk what you need eg paint, canvas; i will send you the pic and we can discuss), and then we make it together.
I am a rank beginner nor artistically included. We have 8 weeks if we start on april 6th to get this done. You can do the heavy lifting but coach me on simpler aspects of the painting. Open to watercolor/acrylic/oil etc. and style (realistic vs more impressionist etc.) size of painting, we can discuss all of it.
